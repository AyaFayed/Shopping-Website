      The Galaxy S21 has a design similar to its predecessor, with an Infinity-O
      display containing a circular cutout in the top center for the front
      selfie camera. The S21's back panel is reinforced poly-carbonate similar
      to the S20 FE and Note 20, while the S21+ and S21 Ultra use glass.[8] The
      rear camera array has been integrated into the phone body and has a
      metallic surround; the S21 Ultra has a carbon fiber camera surround for
      exclusive colors.
